## Description

  + Purpose

    The purpose of my portfolio website is to practice and to show my professional web development, Project Planning, & execution skills to the world using a simple and clean website.

    Through this website I am also hoping to get in contact with perspective employers for employment opportunities and with like minded developers for collaboration on open source projects.
